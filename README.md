Max Sum Matrix: This repository contains a C implementation to find the maximum sum submatrix within a given larger matrix. The code aims to determine the submatrix that has the highest sum of elements. The user is prompted to enter the dimensions of the big matrix and the range of random numbers to fill it with. Then, the user can specify the dimensions of the submatrix to search for the maximum sum.
